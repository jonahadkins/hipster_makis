###So...
*i got [this shirt](https://www.instagram.com/p/i1fJNMCBUr/) a few years ago, i've always equated it's design to "Symbols on a Map", and i've always wanted to make them legit map symbols. thus...*

# hipster_makis
a bad attempt at Maki symbols from one of my favorite shirts

15 icons i can only describe as `hipster-esque map symbols from a forgotten map of farm to table farms` 
* license and hormone free, do with them what you will, have your cake and eat it too, and have other people watch you while you eat it.
* pull requests most welcome, im 100% sure they could have been drawn better
* 24px sized svg's, perfect for that `mapbox studio` project you've had on the back-burner
* two flavors, straight & sloppy, so you can maintain maximum hipness while at work
* includes seamless pattern style, perfect for [cool new homepage](http://jonahadkins.github.io) backgrounds

*all design credit to [RCVA](https://www.rvca.com), the manufacturer of the shirt.*  

enjoy!
